# Burger Joint 
The Burger Joint corporate website allows clients of the Burger Joint restaurant to book tables and meals in advance as well as as edit, delete or update their scheduled dine-in bookings should their plans change.  A prerequisite to making a table booking at the Burger Joint restaurant, the client must create or have a registered user account with the Burger Joint restaurant, otherwise, they will not be able to complete a table booking at the restaurant.

## Business Requirements
Prior to initiating the project's development, user stories were created to give a high level understanding of what the platform's functional requirements will be. The user stories were then placed into a kanban board in order to track the progress of the platform's development.  The Agile development kanban board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/Xalil404/projects/3/views/1).

## Wireframes
Once the user stories were completed, the next phase of the project was to complete the UX of all the expected pages and different CRUD functionalites in the platform.  The wireframes were done with a focus on mobile and web; tablets were expected to be an enlarged version of the mobile experience.
