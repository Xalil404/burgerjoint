# Burger Joint 
The Burger Joint corporate website allows clients of the Burger Joint restaurant to book tables and meals in advance as well as as edit, delete or update their scheduled dine-in bookings should their plans change.  A prerequisite to making a table booking at the Burger Joint restaurant, the client must create or have a registered user account with the Burger Joint restaurant, otherwise, they will not be able to complete a table booking at the restaurant.

## Business Requirements
Prior to initiating the project's development, user stories were created to give a high level understanding of what the platform's functional requirements will be. The user stories were then placed into a kanban board in order to track the progress of the platform's development.  The Agile development kanban board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/Xalil404/projects/3/views/1).

## Wireframes
Once the user stories were completed, the next phase of the project was to complete the UX of all the expected pages and different CRUD functionalites in the platform.  The wireframes were done with a focus on mobile and web; tablets were expected to be an enlarged version of the mobile experience.

## Database Schema
After the wire-frames completion, a database schema was created to understand what information should be stored on the back-end.

## Testing
All fucntional testing, user story testing, device compatibility testing and browswer compatibility testing can be found in the [TestingMD](https://github.com/Xalil404/burgerjoint/blob/main/TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

Deployment of the Burger Joint application was done from the very start of the project and continous deployment was performed after every feature implementation in order to avoid any unforeseen hurdles or blockers during the final deployment of the application. Upon implementing the django framework and PostgreSQL databse in the my local environment, in order to deploy the project, the following steps were taken:

* I created a new application in Heroku by giving it an app name and selecting its region.

* Then in Elephant SQL I created a new instance in order to host the database. 

* I copied the Elephant SQL Postgres URL which I then pasted into my env.py file and then added a few lines of code in my settings.py file to make my django project aware of it.

* I completed migration of the database structure to the newly connected ElephantSQL database.

* Once the database had been migrated to ElephantSQL and a Profile for Heroku was created, in the application's Heroku interface I added a few config vars in the project's settings.

* Finally in the app's Heroku interface in the deploy section, I connected the project's Github repository and initiated manual deployment.
